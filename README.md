Module 6 Assignment 

Here is my submission for module 6. I had exteme difficulties trying to configure the GitIgnore, so I ended up editing the code straight in the editor on GitHub as I think that the desired effect is accomplished this way as well, thanks. 

Please reach out if there are any problems regarding the submission.
